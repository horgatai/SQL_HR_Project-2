## Page 1 — Overview

![Overview](screenshots/powerbi/1.1.png)

**Analysis:** Out of 27,901 students surveyed, 58.55% are classified as depressed — a majority. The donut chart confirms the imbalance: 16K depressed vs 12K not depressed. Depression rate is virtually identical across genders (58.63% male vs 58.45% female), indicating that gender is not a meaningful differentiating factor in this dataset.

## Page 2 — Demographics

![Demographics](screenshots/powerbi/2.1.png)

**Analysis:** Age is one of the strongest demographic predictors — students under 20 have a 74% depression rate, dropping to 41% for those aged 30+. Younger students face more pressure with less coping experience. Among degree types, Class 12 stands out at 71% — these are Indian high school final-year students facing board exams that determine university admission. Postgraduate degrees (M.Tech, M.Ed) show the lowest rates around 51%. Geographically, Hyderabad leads at 67%, though all top 10 cities exceed 53%, suggesting depression is a widespread issue rather than city-specific.

## Page 3 — Lifestyle Factors

**Analysis:** All three lifestyle factors show a clear relationship with depression. Students sleeping less than 5 hours have a 65% depression rate vs 51% for those sleeping more than 8 hours. Diet shows an even stronger pattern — unhealthy eaters reach 71% vs 45% for healthy diet, a 26 percentage point gap. Work/study hours follow the same trend: students studying 9–12 hours daily hit 68% depression rate compared to 44% for those studying 0–4 hours. The data consistently suggests that overworking, poor sleep, and bad diet compound each other.

## Page 4 — Academic & Financial Pressure

![Academic Financial Pressure](screenshots/powerbi/4.1.png)

**Analysis:** Both line charts show a near-linear rise in depression as pressure increases. Academic pressure climbs from ~20% at level 1 to 86% at level 5. Financial stress follows an even steeper curve — from 32% at level 1 to 81% at level 5. The high-risk KPI card shows that students simultaneously facing high academic pressure, high financial stress, poor sleep, and prior suicidal thoughts have a 95.99% depression rate — effectively a certainty.

## Page 5 — Risk Factors

![Risk Factors](screenshots/powerbi/5.1.png)

**Analysis:** Suicidal thoughts are the strongest binary predictor in the dataset — students who have had them show a 79% depression rate vs just 23% for those who haven't, a 56 percentage point gap. Family history of mental illness has a more modest effect (61% vs 56%), suggesting it is a contributing factor rather than a primary driver. Study satisfaction shows a clear downward trend — depression rate drops from 71% at satisfaction level 1 to 47% at level 5. The spike at level 0 (60%) comes from a very small group of 10 students and should be interpreted with caution.
